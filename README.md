# 📖 Audiobook Studio

Turn any text into a narrated audiobook — right from your desktop, no GPU required.

Load a PDF, EPUB, plain text file, or paste content directly. Pick a voice (or clone your own from a short audio clip), tweak the speed and tone, and generate a full MP3 audiobook. The app intelligently splits your text at sentence boundaries, generates each section, and merges everything into one file.

Powered by [PocketTTS](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts) by Kyutai — a lightweight text-to-speech model that runs entirely on CPU.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Double-click **`run_pocket_embedded.bat`** — it downloads everything automatically:

1. Embedded Python 3.12
2. FFmpeg for audio processing
3. CPU-only PyTorch + all dependencies
4. Launches the app

> First run takes a few minutes to set up. After that, launches are instant.

## 🛠️ Manual Setup
